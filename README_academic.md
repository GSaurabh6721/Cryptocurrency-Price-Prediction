# Project: Cryptocurrency Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## Overview

This project aims to predict the price movements of popular cryptocurrencies using linear regression models. By leveraging historical price data, the project seeks to forecast future trends for Monero, Ethereum, Wrapped Bitcoin, and Bitcoin.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Historical price data for various cryptocurrencies.
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive plots to visualize price trends.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Linear regression models to predict future prices.
- **Evaluation**: Model performance metrics to assess prediction accuracy.

## Dataset

The dataset includes historical price data for the following cryptocurrencies:
- Monero (XMR)
- Ethereum (ETH)
- Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC)
- Bitcoin (BTC)

Each dataset contains columns such as Date, High, Low, Open, Close, Volume, and Marketcap.

## Methodology

1. **Data Loading**: Load the historical price data for each cryptocurrency.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Create a target variable for predicting 'N' days into the future.
3. **Data Visualization**: Plot the price trends using Plotly.
4. **Model Training**: Train linear regression models on the historical data.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the models using the coefficient of determination (RÂ²).
6. **Prediction**: Use the trained models to predict future prices.

## Results

The linear regression models achieved high confidence scores for each cryptocurrency:
- Monero: 96.55%
- Ethereum: 97.47%
- Wrapped Bitcoin: 97.63%
- Bitcoin: 98.52%

The models successfully predicted the price movements for the next 5 days with high accuracy.

## Conclusion

The project demonstrates the effectiveness of linear regression models in predicting cryptocurrency price movements. The high confidence scores indicate that the models can be reliably used for short-term price forecasting.

## Future Work

- Explore more advanced machine learning models for improved accuracy.
- Incorporate additional features such as trading volume and market sentiment.
- Develop a real-time prediction system for continuous monitoring.
